# WeatherBuddy

WeatherBuddy is an Android application built using Kotlin that provides users with real-time weather information for their current location or any other location of their choice. The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and incorporates various modern Android architecture components and libraries.

## Features

- **Current Weather**: Get up-to-date weather information for your current location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description.
- **Search Locations**: Search for weather conditions in any city or location worldwide.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin**: The app is written entirely in Kotlin, a modern and concise programming language for Android development.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: WeatherBuddy integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve accurate and up-to-date weather data.
- **Retrofit**: Retrofit is used for making HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and handling responses.
- **ViewModel**: The app follows the ViewModel architecture component, which separates the UI logic from the data management and business logic.
- **LiveData**: LiveData is used to observe data changes and automatically update the UI accordingly.
- **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Pattern**: The app adheres to the MVVM architectural pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and testability.
